## Hi there! âš¡

The xDevGuild is a place where MultiversX blockchain developers can collaborate and share their repositories. We have an awesome list of all dev-related resources and a couple of useful repositories. And hopefully, there will be more and more. All will be open source. 

We encourage you to join and contribute. You can start by adding some interesting links to the [awesome-multiversx-dev-resources](https://github.com/xdevguild/awesome-multiversx-dev-resources). 

You can also reach us if you would like to be a curator of your repository here in the Guild. [JOIN!](https://github.com/orgs/xdevguild/discussions/1)

If you would like to discuss something related to the Guild and MultiversX dev stuff, you could try the [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/xdevguild/discussions) section.

**Remember** that we don't have any audits for smart contracts, and we can't provide any guarantees for any tool which will be linked or published here. Please review and understand the code first before using it in production.
